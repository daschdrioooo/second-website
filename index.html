        <h1>This is a test website for me to test my skills on</h1>
        <h2>Log 1</h2>
        <p>I'm going to add an image into here</p>
        <img src="chrome://branding/content/about-logo.png" alt="firefox logo">
        <p>I put the firefox logo cuz it was the only logo i could find here without internet</p>
        <p>I can't currently see what my website looks like because I don't have internet right now</p>
        <p>Because i have no internet right now, I can't actually look up the website.</p>
        <p>If, for whatever reason your browser couldn't load the image, i imagine that it would say firefox logo in the image's place</p>
        <p>I'm going to keep updating this page and my github repo with things that I learn so hopefully this website soon becomes a really good one</p>
        <p>If you're interested in what I can see on my end, then you can right click on the page and hit inspect.</p>
        <p>I think this will be the end of this log for now. I'll probably commit this to github later. See you soon!</p>

        <p>Tick if you like my website</p><input type="checkbox">

        <p>Type your name in here</p><input type="text">
        <p>Look! I added a text box!</p>
        <p>I can even make a text box that you can't type in, watch!</p>
        <input type="text" disabled>
        <p>I think I'm gonna end this log now. I'm gonna commit to github, and see you later!</p>
